## Design

[Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nothing+You+Could+Do)

Images will appear in the same box size for the landing page, and then their natural size in 
Landing page for showing different paintings, sell them with shippo + stripe.
Admin page where the owner can add new art, post to social media, create descriptions from art.

## Animation

The images should have fade in and out.
The SVG signature should animate with strokes from ltr.

## Github

To create a new painting, I'll use a Github OAuth login where only my mom is authorized.
Should take her to the admin page after where she can do stuff with the OAuth token.
