Vercel doesn't allow their free static hosting to be used for business purposes (Cloudflare/Netlify does).

You can use gmail to send emails subject to their [daily quota](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/quota)

Sendgrid is more for email campaigns, transactional emails at scale, analytics, etc.

## Pnpm

https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8878#issuecomment-2546442011
https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.0.0-rc.0
https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8378
https://pnpm.io/npmrc

Unlike npm/yarn, pnpm can hoist dependencies to the root of `node_modules` using public-hoist where the dependency will be available to every package, or you can hoist to `node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules` (the default) to benefit from the file/installation benefits of pnpm. Dependencies installed with pnpm are saved once in a store on your computer and away from your project. This means dependencies of dependencies (like `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, which `eslint-config-next` relies on) arenâ€™t automatically available at the root of `node_modules` unless explicitly hoisted with public-hoist. ESLint assumes plugins like `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` are globally accessible in `node_modules`, when they're not found you can get the error "failed to load plugin". 

Historically, public-hoist defaulted to ['*eslint*', '*prettier*'] (up to pnpm v9), but now in version 10 it's [].

```sh
# Until nextjs releases a flat config instead of that FlatCompat meme
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@nextui-org/*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*eslint*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*prettier*
```

## Astro

I found out that NextJS <Image> optimization can only be used at request time, not build time.
I got the feeling that NextJS was fine for SSG but not ideal, most of the docs is written for SSR/RSC stuff.
Astro uses zod to generate typings for all my content which I liked (have to run `pnpm dev`).
It also had SSG Image optimization and more docs written for SSG which I liked.

## OAuth 2.0

A github login alone only verifies the user's identity, not the frontend's identity.
A bad actor can copy my entire frontend and host it on their own domain.
If the user signs into Github on the imposter site and redirects back, the imposter site gets the OAuth token.
I need my own server with a `client_secret` (identifying my app) that github redirects to instead.

The URL for requesting a Github token can also be forged by a bad actor (user can be tricked into calling it).
To make sure it's an authentic request, I attach a nonce/state to the request.
When my server gets a callback from the Github server, it will check if the response nonce matches the client nonce.

CSRF isn't just about cookies.

### OAuth 2.0 Flow

/login -> github login -> /admin-oauth -> /admin -> /admin-oauth -> /admin (now with token)

After a successful login, it redirects the browser to /admin-oauth, then it redirects the browser to /admin-callback with `code` and `state` to check if the state is a match, then it makes a post request to `/admin-oauth` to get the token, then it redirects again to /admin with the token.
