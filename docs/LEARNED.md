Vercel doesn't allow their free static hosting to be used for business purposes (Cloudflare/Netlify does).

You can use gmail to send emails subject to their [daily quota](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/quota)

Sendgrid is more for email campaigns, transactional emails at scale, analytics, etc.

## Pnpm

https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8878#issuecomment-2546442011
https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v10.0.0-rc.0
https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/8378
https://pnpm.io/npmrc

Unlike npm/yarn, pnpm can hoist dependencies to the root of `node_modules` using public-hoist where the dependency will be available to every package, or you can hoist to `node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules` (the default) to benefit from the file/installation benefits of pnpm. Dependencies installed with pnpm are saved once in a store on your computer and away from your project. This means dependencies of dependencies (like `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, which `eslint-config-next` relies on) arenâ€™t automatically available at the root of `node_modules` unless explicitly hoisted with public-hoist. ESLint assumes plugins like `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` are globally accessible in `node_modules`, when they're not found you can get the error "failed to load plugin". 

Historically, public-hoist defaulted to ['*eslint*', '*prettier*'] (up to pnpm v9), but now in version 10 it's [].

```sh
# Until nextjs releases a flat config instead of that FlatCompat meme
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@nextui-org/*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*eslint*
public-hoist-pattern[]=*prettier*
```

## Astro

I found out that NextJS <Image> optimization can only be used at request time, not build time.
I got the feeling that NextJS was fine for SSG but not ideal, most of the docs is written for SSR/RSC stuff.
Astro uses zod to generate typings for all my content which I liked (have to run `pnpm dev`).
It also had SSG Image optimization and more docs written for SSG which I liked.

## OAuth 2.0

A github login is not enough, it only verifies the user's identity, not the frontend's identity (1).
Assuming my app is a client-side SSG website with no server, a malicious actor can copy my entire frontend and host it on their own domain.
The user could get tricked into signing into github legitimately, and the imposter website can steal their token.
That's why I need to add my own server that I trust on MY domain's url so I can give it the client secret (which identifies my app).
I can't trust the client secret on my frontend because it's public, but I can trust my domain url, which has my private server.

I.e. the reason why I need to pay for my own server and can't rely on Github login is because of (1), it doesn't verify my website, only the user.
